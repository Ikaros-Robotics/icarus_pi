# Icarus ðŸª½

### Welcome to Ikaros Robotics' first venture, Project Icarus!

Icarus is an open-source project that students or hobbyists can recreate to gain experience with ROS, SLAM, and Nav2. It is also a way for us to share our love of robotics! Icarus is a four-wheeled, mecanum-drive robot capable of manual and autonomous navigation. This is the project's main repository and contains all of the information and code to create the physical robot. Our sub-repo ([Icarus Jetson Nano Repository](https://github.com/steelgit/icarus_nano)) contains all of the information needed to add autonomous navigation to the robot and can be used independently of Icarus.
