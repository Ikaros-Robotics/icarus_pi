# Icarus ðŸª½

### Welcome to Ikaros Robotics' first venture, Project Icarus!

Icarus is an open-source project that students or hobbyists can recreate to gain experience with ROS, SLAM, and Nav2. It is also a way for us to share our love of robotics! Icarus is a four-wheeled, mecanum-drive robot capable of manual and autonomous navigation. This is the project's main repository and contains all of the information and code to create the physical robot. Our sub-repo ([Icarus Jetson Nano Repository](https://github.com/steelgit/icarus_nano)) contains all of the information required to add autonomous navigation to the robot and can be used without recreating Icarus.

# Initial Run

>[Install the pigpio library](https://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/download.html)

>To install all of the required dependencies from the package.xml run:

    rosdep update --include-eol-distros    
<br />

    rosdep install --from-paths src -y --ignore-src --rosdistro foxy

<br />
<br />

# To Launch Icarus

>On startup, launch the PiGPIO Daemon using:

    sudo pigpiod

>Launch the robot!

    ros2 launch icarus_pi launch_robot.launch.py 

<br />
<br />

# To Launch Icarus in Simulation

>With Planar Controller:

    ros2 launch icarus_pi launch_sim_planar.launch.py 

>With Mecanum Controller:

    ros2 launch icarus_pi launch_sim_mecanum.launch.py
