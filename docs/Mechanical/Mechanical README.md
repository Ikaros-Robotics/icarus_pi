# Information on Constructing the Robot
The following parts will need to have brass inserts melted into them. We accomplished this by using a soldering iron to heat up the plastic around the mounting holes and then using pliers to slide in the brass inserts.

- Raspberry Pi Holder (only where the pi mounts to the board)
- Motor Holders
- L298N Holder (where L298N mounts to board)
- Supports for each layer
- Switch Carriages
- Nano mount
- RPLiDAR mount (where LiDAR mounts to the board, may need a smaller brass insert)
